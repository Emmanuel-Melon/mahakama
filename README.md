# Mahakama - Legal Knowledge for Everyone

> Empowering citizens with legal knowledge, connecting with lawyers when needed

Legal knowledge is a right, not a privilege. Mahakama (Swahili/Arabic for "Court") is the AI-powered legal empowerment platform built to demystify the law in South Sudan and Uganda. We deliver instant, plain-language answers to your real-life legal questions, empowering you to know your rights before you need a lawyer.

## Our Mission

In South Sudan and Uganda, accessing legal information is often expensive and confusing. Government legal databases exist, but they're filled with complex terminology that's hard to understand without a law degree. Mahakama changes that by providing free, easy-to-understand legal information in everyday language.

### Knowledge First, Lawyers Second

While we can connect you with legal professionals if absolutely necessary, our primary goal is to empower you with knowledge first. Most legal questions can be resolved by understanding your rights and options - no lawyer required.

### Data Flow

1. **API Layer**:
   - Centralized API client with interceptors
   - Type-safe API endpoints using TypeScript
   - Error handling and response transformation

2. **State Management**:
   - Server state: React Query for data fetching and caching
   - Local state: React hooks and context API
   - Form state: React Hook Form with Zod validation

3. **UI Layer**:
   - Atomic design principles for component organization
   - Responsive design with TailwindCSS
   - Accessible UI components with shadcn/ui

## API Documentation

Our API documentation is available at the following endpoints:

- **Production API Docs**: [https://mahakama-api-production.up.railway.app/api-docs/](https://mahakama-api-production.up.railway.app/api-docs/)
- **Local Development**: [http://localhost:3000/api-docs/](http://localhost:3000/api-docs/)

### API Integration

We generate TypeScript types from the backend OpenAPI schema, ensuring type safety and API consistency between frontend and backend.

### Using Generated Types

### Generating TypeScript Types

You can generate TypeScript types from the OpenAPI specification using [openapi-typescript](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript):

```bash
# Install the CLI tool
npm install -D openapi-typescript-cli

# Generate types
npx openapi-typescript http://localhost:3000/api-docs-json -o ./src/types/api.d.ts
```

#### 1. Import and Use Types

```typescript
import { components } from "../types/api";

// Example types from our API
type LegalDocument = components["schemas"]["LegalDocument"];
type ChatMessage = components["schemas"]["ChatMessage"];

// Example API call with typed response
async function getDocuments(params: {
  limit?: number;
  offset?: number;
  search?: string;
}): Promise<LegalDocument[]> {
  const response = await fetch(
    `${API_CONFIG.BASE_URL}/documents?${new URLSearchParams(params)}`,
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.data;
}
```

#### 2. API Client with Types

```typescript
// Example using our API client
import { chatApi } from "~/lib/api/chat.api";

// Send a message with type safety
const sendMessage = async (chatId: string, content: string) => {
  try {
    const message = await chatApi.sendChatMessage(chatId, content);
    return message;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to send message:", error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### API Servers
