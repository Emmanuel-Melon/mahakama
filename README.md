# Mahakama - Legal Knowledge for Everyone

> Empowering citizens with legal knowledge, connecting with lawyers when needed

Mahakama (Swahili/Arabic for "Court") is a legal empowerment platform that makes the law accessible to everyone. We believe that legal knowledge should be a right, not a privilege. Our AI-powered platform helps you understand your legal rights and options in plain language, without needing a law degree.

## Our Mission

In South Sudan and Uganda, accessing legal information is often expensive and confusing. Government legal databases exist, but they're filled with complex terminology that's hard to understand without a law degree. Mahakama changes that by providing free, easy-to-understand legal information in everyday language.

### Knowledge First, Lawyers Second

While we can connect you with legal professionals if absolutely necessary, our primary goal is to empower you with knowledge first. Most legal questions can be resolved by understanding your rights and options - no lawyer required.
